## Overview

The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is an interactive web application designed to visualize the microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) found in individuals' navels. The project aims to explore the biodiversity of belly buttons and provide insights into the various bacterial species present.

## Features

- **Dropdown Menu**: Select a test subject's ID to view their specific microbial data.
- **Demographic Info Panel**: Displays selected test subject's demographic information.
- **Bar Chart**: Shows the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual.
- **Bubble Chart**: Visualizes the relative frequency of all microbial species found in the selected individual.
- **Gauge Chart**: Represents the belly button washing frequency of the selected individual.

## Live Dashboard
